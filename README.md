Mainor Weather

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

In order to be able to use this project, you need to:

1. Create a .env file
2. Enter a key OPEN_AI_KEY=<your key>
   If you don't have an OpenAI account, you still need to do those steps and enter a "dummy" key
   value, but the recommendations won't work
